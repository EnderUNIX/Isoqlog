Isoqlog 2.2.x INSTALL

- Installation

1. ./configure
	If you would like to use default options just type 'configure'
	To see more options type 'configure --help'

2. make
	Compiling...
3. make install
	Installing...
4. make clean
	Removing objects files...

copy images and library directory that under htmltemp directory to isoqlog output directory 
5. cp -pr ./htmltemp/images ./htmltemp/library isoqlogoutputdir/

6. You can run isoqlog more than once in a day, though you must run at least once before 00:00 
(i.e. 23:58) to get current day's statistics.

7. If you're using postfix, sendmail or qmail-syslog, it is strongly suggested you rotate
   your log files to get the data healthier.

# crontab -e

58 * * * * /usr/local/bin/isoqlog 1>/dev/null 2>/dev/null
this will run isoqlog every hour at 58. minute

That's all
IMPORTANT NOTE: If you type make and get an error like:
Makefile line:XXX need an operator, you better use gmake, not make.

- Files
	When you untar package, you should see following files and directories:

	Makefile -> You know what is this.
	configure -> Prepares your system for custom installations.
	isoqlog.conf -> Configuration file. (more isoqlog.conf)
	isoqlog.domains -> Domains
	htmltemp -> Contains HTML output templates. Edit them if you would like.
	
- After installation
	
	Don't forget! If you configure your system with 'configure --prefix=install_dir' 
edit isoqlog.conf and change prefix variables. Also change others.
        
NOTE: 
	 An important thing to note here is that; keep the size of your log file large.
	 if you're using qmail with multilog, you can set this in the qmail-send/log/run
	 file with the s (size) parameter like this: (all in one line) 
	 #!/bin/sh 
	 exec /usr/local/bin/setuidgid  \
	 qmaill /usr/local/bin/multilog  t s5000000 \
	  /var/log/qmail

	  if you're using syslog, change the rotate size.
